# DS-Course-Project-2021-Repetitive-Shortest-Paths
Project for “Engineering Distributed Infrastructure: A MSc Course”: go/ds-course

### Main goal
The main goal of this project is to design and implement a system capable of finding shortest
paths in a graph, repetitively. By “repetitiveness” we mean an ability to scalably serve find-shortest-path queries with given start
and target vertices, after the system stabilizes.
